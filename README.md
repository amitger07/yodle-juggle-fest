My solution to Yodle's puzzle found at http://www.yodlecareers.com/puzzles/jugglefest.html . Uses Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the maximum path from top to bottom.

Instructions:

To run from command line, navigate to the \dist\ folder and enter "java -jar YodleJuggleFest.jar" to run with the default jugglefest.txt Alternatively, enter "java -jar YodleJuggleFest.jar [fileName]" to use a different file as input.
